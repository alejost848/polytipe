# Polytipe
Polytipe is a prototyping tool for creating web applications, make usability tests, get analytics and feedback from users and generate code all in one place. The tool is built with agile development in mind and offers a way to bridge the gap between designing interfaces on a graphic environment and implementing them in code. The platform is built with Polymer under the hood to allow the reuse of web components and to make use of their set of elements following the Material Design specs.

Polytipe aims to be the best open source prototyping tool available that uses web components at its core for creating fast and reusable prototypes, so when you are done testing them with users you can jump right into coding. Join the project

## Overview
When you first launch Polytipe you'll be asked for you Github credentials and to give permission to the app to create repos. After this the repository polytipe-projects will be forked from [here](https://github.com/polytipe/polytipe-projects) and will be added to your account. Polytipe runs entirely on the browser and the projects you create are stored as branches on the repository that was just created. From there, you can create multiple interfaces using the editor and preview interactions between them. After your prototype is done you can export your project as a website using Github Pages and share the link to others to test your application. Users will be able to send feedback using their Github accounts and they will be added as issues in your repository. If you want to receive user analytics you can also link your Google account and use a tracking number from Google Analytics to monitor the activity of your users. When you are done working in your prototype you can export it as a zip that contains the code of your project and continue the development in your favorite text editor.
